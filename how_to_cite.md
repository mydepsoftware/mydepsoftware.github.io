<p> A paper related to the software is in preparation for the Biophysical Journal (Computational Tools category). 
A tentative reference would be:</p>
<p> Cottet, J., Fabregue, O., Buret, F., Renaud, P. & Frénéa-Robin, M. MyDEP: a new computational tool for dielectric modelling of particles and cells and simulation of their dielectrophoretic response spectra. Biophysical Journal (2018 (Paper in preparation))</p>

<p>The reference will be updated once the paper is in press.</p>
